# The-Gaming-Room
The Gaming Room, the client for this project, requested a web-based multiplayer game called Draw It or Lose It. This game involves teams guessing progressively revealed images within timed rounds, requiring real-time interaction, unique game and player identifiers, and strict gameplay management. Our goal was to design scalable, cross-platform software that ensures only one active game instance exists in memory, supports multiple teams and players, and renders images at precise intervals. We carefully considered technical constraints—like real-time synchronization and platform independence—and chose a Linux-based server architecture for its scalability, security, and cost-efficiency. Object-oriented principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and composition were effectively used in the domain model to support system requirements and maintain code reusability.

The design documentation process was especially valuable in clarifying system structure before development. The UML diagram and architectural planning helped define relationships between components and informed decisions around singleton patterns and session management. One area for improvement would be expanding the system architecture section with diagrams to better visualize data flow and real-time communication. Interpreting user needs—fast-paced gameplay, intuitive interaction, and reliable performance—was central to the design, guiding decisions around UI responsiveness, naming constraints, and gameplay fairness. In future projects, I’d continue using early domain modeling and platform evaluations while incorporating feedback loops and prototyping to enhance design validation and implementation efficiency.
